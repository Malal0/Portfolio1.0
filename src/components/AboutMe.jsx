                <h3>why I chose this career</h3>
                <p>In 2019 I went to school for Pipefitting in Oklahoma. I became NCCER Lvl 3 Certified within 5 months. I was on my way to starting a high paying new career. My teacher even took me with him on my first Pipefitter job in the begining of 2020. It was a great experience that paid me very well for a two week job. Before I could look for my next pipefitting job the whole world SHUTDOWN. All of the sudden no one was hiring and in fact many places were firing people or closing down forever.
                    I was jobless and living off of my last paycheck for a couple of months, until I had to move back in with my parents. I began working at a steel manufacturing company where I drove many different size forklifts moving many different size pieces of metal. I moved them everyday from A to B. I moved them in sweltering hot heat, bone chilling cold, and even in relentless rain storms. Needless to say the endless cycle of moving things from A to B was mind numbing. I felt like I needed a challenging career.
                    Code had always interested me,  and at the time it was a challenge for me. I didn’t even know how to right a simple for loop. So I decided I was going to learn how to code. I’ve gained so much knowledge since then. I’ve made a couple of projects and I have so many more to make. My journey will coninue</p>
